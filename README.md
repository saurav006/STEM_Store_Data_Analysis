# Enhancing_ECommerce_Efficiency_using_Advanced_SQL_and_Python

This GitHub repository hosts the project developed to optimize delivery vendor and driver allocation for 'STEM Store,' an e-commerce platform. Using Python, synthetic data was generated and preprocessed. An RFM analysis with SQL segmented customers for targeted marketing, enhancing satisfaction. Advanced SQL queries were employed to optimize vendor allocation based on cost and efficiency, while driver allocation improved delivery efficiency. Key metrics, such as Cost Per Order, reduction in delays, and driver count, assessed the efficiency improvements. The repository includes detailed documentation on data generation, preprocessing steps, SQL queries used, and instructions on how to set up and run the optimizations.
